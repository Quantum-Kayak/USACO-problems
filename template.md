# 🐄 Problem Name – USACO [Division] ([Month Year])

This directory contains a C++ solution to the **"[Problem Name]"** problem from the USACO [Division] division.

## 📜 Problem Summary
> Your own words summary of what’s going on, who’s angry (usually cows), and what you’re solving.

## 📥 Input Format
- Line-by-line breakdown
- Optional sample input

## 📤 Output Format
- What it prints
- Optional example output

## 💡 Strategy
- Key idea / pattern used
- Edge cases handled
- Algorithm + time complexity

## 🚀 How to Run
```sh
g++ -std=c++17 -o problem problem.cpp
./problem < input.txt > output.txt
```
## 🧠 **Time Complexity**  
Break it down cleanly:

- Reading/expanding segments: O(n + m)  
- Comparison loop: O(100)  
- Overall: O(n + m)

## 🛠 Why This Exists

- To **practice USACO-style competitive programming**  
- To **build searchable knowledge** of problem-solving patterns  
- To **leave behind a map** for myself (and maybe others) on how I solved — or suffered through — each problem

Happy coding. May your segments never overflow, and your trees remain acyclic.
