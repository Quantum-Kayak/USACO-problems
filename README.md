# 🐄 USACO Problems Repository

Welcome to my collection of USACO problems, solved, categorized, and mildly roasted. This archive is meant to be a long-term knowledge base, a strategy journal, and a reminder that I once thought brute force was a good idea.

Each problem comes with:

- ✅ A complete `.cpp` solution  
- 🧠 A markdown write-up (`.md`) summarizing strategy, edge cases, and lessons learned  
- 🦥 Occasional `TLE.cpp` files that document slow, tragic failures  
- 🗂 Organized by division, difficulty, and sanity level

## 📁 Structure

USACO-problems/
├── bronze/
│ ├── starred/
│ └── unstarred/
├── silver/
├── gold/
└── plat/

Problems are sorted into folders by:
- `division` (bronze/silver/etc.)
- `difficulty` (easy/normal/hard/insane)
- `starred` if worth revisiting
- Markdown files may have `.XN.md` if the problem was cursed

## 🛠 Why This Exists

- To practice USACO-style competitive programming  
- To build a searchable log of problem-solving strategies  
- To shame myself into writing actual documentation  
- To avoid repeating the same mistakes next month

## 💀 Regret Taxonomy

Each markdown write-up may include:
- 🔖 Tags for topic/difficulty/regret
- 🚧 Dead-end ideas I chased too long
- 😭 The moment I realized it was prefix sums again

Happy coding. May your arrays be zero-indexed and your graphs acyclic.
