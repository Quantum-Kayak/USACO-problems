# 🐄 USACO Problems Repository

Welcome to my archive of solved USACO problems, organized for brutal clarity, long-term reference, and future self-roasting. Each problem includes:

- ✅ A `.cpp` file with the complete solution
- 🧠 A `README.md` (or `.XN.md`) with an explanation, strategy breakdown, and mental notes
- 🦥 Sometimes a `TLE.cpp` cause I was too slow
- ⌚ Some problems will have multiple solutions as part of mock contests, marked by `pracn`
- 🗂 Sorted by **division**, **difficulty**, and **problem metadata**

## 🎯 Naming Convention

Each problem folder contains:

- `problemname.cpp` → The actual C++ solution  
- `problemname.md` → Writeup and explanation  
- `problemname.XN.md` → If the problem is cursed, deranged, or deserves its own therapy session
- `problemname.TLE.cpp` → If I was too slow the first time around

**Examples:**
```text
bronze/starred/easy/blockgame/
├── blockgame.cpp
└── blockgame.md

silver/unstarred/hard/fencedin/
├── fencedin.cpp
└── fencedin.XN.md
```
Happy coding. May your arrays be zero-indexed and your graphs acyclic.
